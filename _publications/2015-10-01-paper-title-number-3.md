excerpt: 'We build a novel deep compressive confocal microscope (DCCM). Combined with a deep learning reconstruction algorithm (DCCM-Net), our DCCM is able to achieve high-quality confocal microscopic imaging with low phototoxicity. Our imaging experiments with fluorescent microspheres demonstrate its capability of achieving single-pixel confocal imaging with a sampling ratio of only approximately 0.05%. In the prototype of our DCCM system, the imaging rates can achieve up to 833 fps and 13.65 megapixel/s.'
