excerpt: 'A deep learning-enhanced single-molecule spectrum imaging method (SpecGAN) for improving the single-molecule spectrum imaging efficiency. With SpecGAN, the super-resolution spectrum image of the COS-7 membrane can be reconstructed with merely 12,000 frames of single-molecule localization images, which is almost half of the previously reported frame count for spectrally resolved super-resolution imaging.'

The existence of a scattering medium causes the degeneration of intensity and phase information, especially in
biological imaging. The present techniques to address this challenge only focus on the reconstruction of intensity
information, yet few attempts have tried to recover the phase information. We propose a method to simultaneously
predict both intensity and phase information from a speckle image employing a deep despeckle complex
neural network (DespeckleNet). By combining the advantages of both the complex network and the generative adversarial
network framework, our method enables the high contrast single-shot imaging of complicated biological
samples through scattering media without labeling. Various experiments demonstrate the superior reconstruction
and generalization performance of our method under multiple types of biological samples with diﬀerent scatter-
ing media. We also provide the real-time observation of living cellular activities without any contaminations or
damages to the cells. Our method oﬀers simple yet eﬀective imaging through scattering media and paves the way
for real-time unlabeled biological imaging.
